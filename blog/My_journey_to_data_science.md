My Journey into Data Science\
By Andy Wang

This is the content of my first blog article. I want to share how i start to learn about Data Science My Journey into Data Science

This winter vacation, I embarked on an educational journey into the world of data science. My initial exposure came from a video detailing the various career opportunities in the field and what to expect during the job application process. A key takeaway was the realization that the demand for high-caliber talent extends beyond high-tech companies to any organization needing to process data ("Winter Webinar"). An interesting perspective shared in the video highlighted the different focal points of these roles: Data Scientists are more versed in statistics, while Machine Learning Engineers lean more towards computer science aspects.

Key Roles in Data Science 

· Machine Learning Engineer (MLE): MLEs are the backbone of model building and machine learning pipelines, with a strong emphasis on Python and deep learning skills. They are crucial for developing infrastructure that supports sophisticated data processes ("Winter Webinar"，Guo).\
·Data Scientist: These professionals have a foundational knowledge of machine learning and deep learning, assisting in model training and enhancements. Their role also involves data visualization and managing both structured and unstructured data (Guo；"Data Analyst vs. Data Scientist").\
· Data Analyst: I see Data Analysts as a more accessible version of Data Scientists. They primarily focus on data processing using tools like SQL and Python without engaging in complex modeling tasks. Their work is integral to the operational aspects of a company, such as developing key performance indicators and solving data-related issues (Guo; "Data Analyst vs. Data Scientist").\
· Business Analyst: This role requires less technical skill but a higher degree of business acumen and communication abilities. Business Analysts are adept at using simpler platforms like Python and Excel to transform complex data insights into actionable business strategies ("Winter Webinar").

A Day in the Life of a Data Analyst ("Winter Webinar")

· Morning (10 AM - 12 PM): The day starts with reviewing previous data performances, identifying anomalies or fluctuations, and formulating solutions.\
· Early Afternoon (2 PM - 4 PM): Focused analysis on targeted customers, like demographic profiling, and conducting experiments to test theories.\
· Late Afternoon (4 PM - 6 PM): Meetings with clients or colleagues to discuss project progress, current data challenges, and necessary adjustments based on new requirements. \
· Evening (After 6 PM): Dedicated time for personal development in data infrastructure and modeling.
