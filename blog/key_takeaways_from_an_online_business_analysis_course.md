Over the last winter vacation, I joined an online business case study course to explore how data science and statistics knowledge can be applied to real-world business scenarios. Through the guidance of the instructor, Lilian, I learned how business analysts leverage data analysis skills and business insights to tackle practical problems systematically, using tools such as Google Sheets and other online resources. In this blog, I’d like to share my key takeaways from this valuable learning experience.

# Chapter 1: Problem-solving Mindset and Preparation
In the first chapter, Lilian emphasized the crucial preparations needed before diving into a business problem. She recommended approaching large, ambiguous issues systematically by breaking them down into smaller, manageable questions. Upon receiving data, it’s essential to spend a few minutes scanning through the dataset to identify key categories and potential relationships between variables. This initial step helps structure ideas clearly and create an effective outline for further analysis.

# Chapter 2: Structured and Logical Problem Solving
Chapter two highlighted the importance of approaching problems logically and structurally. Before developing our analytical approach, we must understand and acknowledge all given constraints. Once these constraints are clear, the next step involves visualizing the analytical approach and unpacking relevant metrics. This includes breaking down the metrics formula into understandable components and deciding which specific metrics need optimization to achieve the overall business goal.

# Chapter 3: Asking the Right Analytical Questions
In this chapter, Lilian focused on analytical thinking—particularly on how to formulate the right questions. After clearly analyzing the problem, we should identify key opportunities and perspectives that could guide solutions. For each identified opportunity, it’s helpful to ask ourselves four guiding questions:

• What do I want to know?\
• Why do I want to know that?\
• So what? (Define how this information will drive actionable recommendations, connecting business opportunities, data, and actions.)\
• How will it be measured? (Clearly define the success metrics.)

To further enhance the quality of questions, Lilian recommended using role-play and third-person perspective thinking to clarify and pinpoint appropriate metrics when facing uncertainty. A valuable reminder here is that logic precedes data, and thoughtful analysis comes before strategy.

# Chapter 4: Organizing and Preparing Data Analysis

Chapter four outlined the essential steps in preparing and organizing data analysis. The three main stages highlighted were:

• Data Wrangling: Cleaning and preparing raw data.\
• Data Visualization: Graphically presenting insights.\
• Extracting Insights: Interpreting the data to inform decisions.

When creating visualizations, the golden rule is ensuring your graph can be understood by the audience within five seconds. Achieving this requires stepping outside your perspective and objectively evaluating visual clarity. Insights should be concise, clear, and conveyed with minimal yet impactful wording.

# Chapter 5: Crafting an Effective Business Strategy
Lilian emphasized crafting a compelling business strategy in chapter five. A solid strategy presentation begins by summarizing key insights clearly. Following this, we must specify concrete actions and assign clear responsibilities to respective teams. Ending the strategy with measurable goals significantly helps track its effectiveness and maintain clarity and accountability.

# Chapter 7: Building a Business Presentation
In the final chapter covered in this blog, Lilian shared a structured framework for delivering effective business presentations. The recommended structure includes:

1. Cover Slide: Your name and presentation title.
2. Prompt Slide: A brief introduction of your presentation’s purpose.
3. Agenda Slide: Clearly presenting the structure of your presentation.
4. Key Recommendation Slide (Text-only):
   - Summarize core insights and recommendations clearly.
   - Placement may vary according to context.
5. Approach & Framework Slide:
   - Explain your analytical logic clearly.
   - Simplify complex formulas to facilitate easy understanding.
   - Apply creative techniques to boost comprehension.
6. Main Body Slides:
   - Clearly present one insight per slide.
   - Use the formula: Headline = Action Item + Insight + Goal.
   - Ensure slide headlines collectively convey a coherent narrative.
7. Ending Slide: Conclude with a powerful and memorable closing statement.
   
# Conclusion
This course significantly improved my understanding of the role of a business analyst and how data science skills combine effectively with business insights. The structured frameworks and clear steps I learned not only deepened my analytical and strategic capabilities but also provided practical tools and methodologies directly applicable to real-world business cases. I hope these insights benefit you as much as they did for me.
