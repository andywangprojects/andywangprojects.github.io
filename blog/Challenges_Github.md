Today, i want share some of the challenges i faced during the process of learning how to operate github and how i find the solutions for them. 

## · Struggling to Start the Terminal for Testing Git Commands
Initially, I couldn't start the terminal to test various Git commands. After consulting ChatGPT, I was advised to download Git Bash, but this approach didn’t resolve the issue. I also tried using GitHub Desktop, hoping to find the terminal there, but I failed. Eventually, I sought help from my tutor, who identified the root of the problem—I hadn’t specified the correct absolute path to my target directory. With her guidance, I learned how to properly set up the terminal and successfully practiced Git commands.

## · Understanding and Executing GitHub’s Workflow
In Module 3, I was tasked with creating a new repository, adding files via a new branch, and merging the branch back into the main one independently. At first, the online instructions seemed overly complex, and I couldn’t follow them. I turned to ChatGPT, which simplified the process for me. To deepen my understanding, I experimented with GitHub across multiple platforms (online GitHub, GitHub Desktop, and PyCharm). By performing basic tasks such as creating branches, adding files, and editing existing files, I became more familiar with GitHub’s core functions and gained a clear understanding of its workflow.

## · Learning How to Operate GitHub Desktop
As a beginner in GitHub and programming, I initially found it inconvenient and somewhat challenging to use Git commands in the terminal for tasks like adjusting repositories and creating new branches. To address this, I downloaded GitHub Desktop to simplify these operations.
To familiarize myself with GitHub Desktop, I watched tutorial videos explaining its features and referred to the official documentation for step-by-step guidance. These resources helped me understand its core functionalities, such as creating branches, committing changes, and syncing with remote repositories. This process made GitHub Desktop a practical tool for me, bridging the gap between complex Git commands and a user-friendly interface, allowing me to confidently manage repositories.
