## 1.Why I choose to learn Python？
· Versatility: Python has been widely used in many fields and learning how to use Python serves as a transferable skill to enhance my competitiveness. 
·  Beginner-Friendly: Python has simple syntax which is based on English, so I think it is suitable for me, as a beginner, to learn.
· Automation and Efficiency: Python excels in automating repetitive tasks, freeing up time for more creative and meaningful activities.

## 2.What do I like about Python？
· Simplicity and Accessibility: As a high-level, interpreted language, Python simplifies coding with its approachable syntax, which is less prone to exceptions and special cases.

· Open-source Community: The capabilities of the system is continuously upgraded, benefited from the open-source community.

## 3.What are some advantages and differences of Python compared to other programming languages?

· Against Java:
Firstly, Python programs are notably more concise with less stringent syntax rules For instance, a Python programmer does not waste time declaring the types of arguments or variables ("Comparing Python").  However, Python’s dynamic typing—where a variable is determined during program execution— adds flexibility but reduces speed compared to Java. Python serves effectively as a ‘glue’ language without deep concerns for underlying system logic.("Comparing Python")） From my perspective, Java is more like being used to lay the foundation, while Python is more suited as a versatile binder. 

· Against Javascript: 
Unlike Javascript, Python supports true object-oriented programming, which includes the use of classes and inheritance. This feature enhances Python’s capabilities, allowing it to handle larger and more complex software projects. Python's ability to support both non-class-based and class-based coding makes it highly adaptable and suitable for a range of programming tasks, from simple scripts to complex, large-scale applications ("Comparing Python")

· Against Perl: 
Perl is tailored for specific application-oriented tasks such as file scanning and report generating features, while Python focuses on broader programming methodologies such as data structure design and object-oriented programming, and encourages programmers to write readable code by providing an elegant but not overly cryptic notation. 

As a consequence, Python comes close to Perl but rarely beats it in its original application domain; however Python has an applicability well beyond Perl's niche. ("Comparing Python")

· Against Tcl: 
Both languages function as application extension languages (customize the functions and application based on the core architect）and stand-alone programming languages（refers to a comprehensive programming language that can be used independently to develop complete software applications）. However, Tcl primarily treats data as strings, which limits its data structure capabilities and results in slower execution compared to Python. Tcl also lacks advanced features like modular namespaces, essential for large-scale programming. Consequently, large applications in Tcl often require extensions written in C or C++, making development more cumbersome. In contrast, Python supports writing extensive applications entirely in Python, which simplifies development. ("Comparing Python")

·  Against C++:
 Almost everything said for Java also applies for C++, just more so: where Python code is typically 3-5 times shorter than equivalent Java code, it is often 5-10 times shorter than equivalent C++ code! ("Comparing Python"). Anecdotal evidence suggests that one Python programmer can finish in two months what two C++ programmers can't complete in a year. Python shines as a glue language, used to combine components written in C++.

## 4.Conclusion
Python distinguishes itself through its simplicity, efficiency, and broad applicability across different programming tasks. It manages everything from quick scripts to extensive software development more efficiently and with greater readability than counterparts like Java, JavaScript, Perl, Tcl, and C++. As a "glue language," Python particularly excels in integrating components written in other languages, underscoring its utility in contemporary software development.
